eberban
=========

**eberban** is a lojban-inspired language aimed as being simple, regular and
expressive.

- Simple : eberban is only made of predicates which are manipulated with
  particles, with few grammar rules.
- Regular : particles are organised into families with a unique prefix, allowing
  to quickly recognise them.
- Expressive : predicates can be combined in multiple ways to add more details.

> From a lojbanist perspective : it aims at merging brivla and rafsi (by having
> all relation words start with a pair of consonnants followed by vowels and ').
> Following a suggestion by uakci, it'll also try to remove sumti from the
> grammar and working only with predicates themselves.

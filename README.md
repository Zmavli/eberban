eberban
=========

__eberban__ is a [Lojban]-inspired [constructed language] aimed at being simple,
regular and expressive.

- __Simple:__ eberban is made entirely out of predicates, which are manipulated
  with particles, following relatively few yet composable grammar rules.
- __Regular:__ particles are organized into families, each with a unique prefix,
  enabling quick recognition and accelerating learning.
- __Expressive:__ predicates are designed to be combined together to express
  complex meaning.

Most resources are hosted on [GitHub pages], such as :

- parsers, which transform text into a tree structure, that can also be
  visualized as nested boxes.
- a dictionnary allowing to search words and their definitions.
- learning resources to discover the language grammar and concepts.

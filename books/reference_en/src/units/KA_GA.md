# Extrinsic variables (KA/GA)

The **KA** and **GA** families contains particles that can be assigned and used
anywhere in the following text.

All members of the **KA** family (any particle starting with **k**) will bind
with an "individual" variable of the second-order logic. Members of the **GA**
family (any particle starting with **g**) however will bind with a predicate
variable. **KA** can thus be used to refer back to common individuals similarly
to pronouns, while **GA** can allow to define a complex predicate that can be
used multiple times afterward.

In a proposition **KA/GA** can be prefixed with **bo** to discard the previous
variable and create a new independent one. **bo GA** will only declare that
there exist a predicate such that the statement is true. However a more useful
usage is to declare its place structure with a sentence [using
**po**](../struct/PO.md).

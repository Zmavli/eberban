# Propositions and paragraphs (PA/PI/PU)

## Proposition [PA + PAI]

**PA** indicates the start of a sentence, while **pai** indicates the end of
it. Both are elidable, meaning they can be removed if the text would not be
parsed differenly. **PA** is often only used to separate propositions, while
**pai** is more rarely used if something needs to be attached to a proposition a
posteriori.

Each member of **PA** encore a different illocution :

- **pa :** assertive sentence, that can be believ or disbelieved, and is either true or false.
- **pae :** vocative. Defines the listener as the `A` place of this scope.
- **pao :** declarative sentence, that is true only because uttered (used for declarations, announcements, etc).
- **pau :** directive sentence, that is requested, wished or ordered to be true.

## Predicate arguments [PI]

A predicate can be expressed by following **PA/VA/FA** with a list of
[**KA/GA**](../units/KA_GA.md) variables terminated by **pi**. Each
**KA/GA** binds to the `A`, `E`, etc in order.
Any [**ma**](../units/MA.md) in the scope will add bind following places. If
neither **PI** or **ma** are used then the scope have the same place structure
as the first unit in this scope.

## Paragraphs, sections, chapters, ... [PU]

Propositions can be separated by particles of **PU** family, indicating a change
in subject. While **pu** is a small change in subject and is analog to a
paragraph separator; **pua**, **pue**, **pui**, **puo** each express an
even greater change in subject, and can be used to separate subsections,
sections, chapters, etc ...

# Predicate definition (PO)

**po** allows to use a sentence to provide the definition of a **GA**
variable, a root or a compound. It can be present alongside sentences or
after the optional arguments of **VA/FA** scopes. It has an ellidable terminator
**poi** than is used to separate the content of the definition and the content
of the **VA/FA** scope. It is not necessary before a **PA** starting a sentence.

> Defining root or compound using PO should only be used when writing
> dictionnaries or when adding vocabulary based on borrowings.

Another member of **PO** is **poha** that allows to ask a question. Each
argument of the definition is an unknown information that the speaker is
asking. No arguments only ask if the proposition is true or false.

## Exemple

*po ga mian dzo (poi)* (We define "ga" as the property of being a black cat.)
*pa mi don tun ga* (I like all things that satisfies "ga".)

## Subscript [DI]

**di** attaches a number to a word. It can be used to be more
precise when using a vague particle or use more variables.

## Parenthetical note [DO]

**do** and it's terminator **doi** allow to add a parenthetical note. This note
can be any valid eberban text.

## Override [DU]

**du** followed by a single predicate word will override the meaning of the
particle before based on the predicate. Useful to extend eberban grammar, and
also to handle particle questions. Description predicate of a particule can
be obtained with **leu**.

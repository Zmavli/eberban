The word boundary marker __'__ is usually realized as a pause. However other
realizations are allowed to improve the flow of speech :

- Before a vowel-initial word (borrowings, freeform variables and compounds) it
  can be realized as a glotal stop \[ʔ\] instead.
- While borrowings are usually unstressed and end when a pause occurs, it
  is possible to stress their penultimate syllable/vowel, and thus not have to
  pause after it. In general, speakers must take care to not use stress in
  borrowings outside of the penultimate syllable to avoid ambiguities, even if
  the borrowed word in the source language is stressed in another way.

Consecutive vowels are separated by hiatuses, but glides like \[j\] and \[w\]
are allowed respectively alongside or instead of \[i\] and \[u\] unless it is
part of a stressed syllable.

Where spaces are allowed, a speaker or writter can express hesitation by using
one or more of the letter __n__ surrounded by spaces, which is realized as \[n̩\].

In speech, the schwa sound \[ə\] can be used in between consonants of a pair if
the speaker has trouble uttering the pair as-is. It has no written equivalent.

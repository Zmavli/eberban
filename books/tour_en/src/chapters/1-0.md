# Introduction

__eberban__ is a [Lojban]-inspired [constructed language] aimed at being simple,
regular and expressive.

- __Simple:__ eberban is made entirely out of predicates, which are manipulated
  with particles, following relatively few yet composable grammar rules.
- __Regular:__ particles are organized into families, each with a unique prefix,
  enabling quick recognition and accelerating learning.
- __Expressive:__ predicates are designed to be combined together to express
  complex meaning.

This book will provide a detailed tour of the language, covering its concepts
and grammar.

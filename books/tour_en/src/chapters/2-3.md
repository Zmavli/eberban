# Predicate places

Let's look at the definitions of some eberban words :

- djin: `(Ed) desires/wants/wishes [A0].`
- kre: `(Ed) helps [Ad] to satisfy property (O1).`
- kini: `(Ed) learns/studies fact [A0] about (Od).`
- jvin: `(Ed) dances.`
- eberban: `(Ed) is the eberban language.`

The number next to the uppercase vowel indicates that it is a __predicate place__,
with the number being the amount of arguments. This number is called the
__arity__ of the places and predicates.

``gloss
mi djin mi jvin

mi djin mi jvin

{\[E:$(b) is me\]} {\[E:$(b) wants A:$(C)\]}
{$(C) = \[E:$(d) is me\]} {\[E:$(d) dances.\]}

I want that \[Me dancing\] is true/occurs. I want to dance.
``

If this number is greater than 0, it will correspond to the places of
the next predicate in order :

``gloss
mi kre va mo fo kini vo eberban

mi kre va mo fo kini vo eberban

{\[E:$(b) is me\]} {\[E:$(b) helps A:$(c) to O:$(D)\]}
{〈 switch to A:$(c)} {\[E:$(c) is you\]}
{switch to O:$(D)} {O:$(D)(__$(f)__)) = \[E:__$(f)__ learns A:$(g) about O:$(h)\]}
{〈 switch to O:$(h)} {\[E:$(h) is eberban\] 〉 〉}

I help you to learn something about eberban.

> __SE__ could be used before _kini_ to change which place will be used as an
> argument of $(D). However, choosing a place outside of the first predicate
> requires more advanced grammar that will be explained in a later chapter.

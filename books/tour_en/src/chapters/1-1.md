# Morphology

The morphology of eberban is composed of 16 consonants (__n, r, l, m, p, b, f,
v, t, d, s, z, c, j, g, k__), 5 vowels (__i, e, a, o, u__) and finally the
letter __h__, for a total of 22 letters. Among the consonants, __n__, __r__ and
__l__ are designated as (alveolar) __sonorants__, and play an important role in
eberban's morphology. The same letter appearing multiple times in a row is
considered identical to the letter not being repeated.

Words are usually written separated by spaces, however this is not mandatory.
While removing spaces, however, it might be required to add the word boundary
marker symbol __'__ in some places. More than one marker in a row is not
allowed.

Letters are chained one after the other without spaces to form __words__ which
are divided into multiple categories based on their structure.

## Word types

### Particles

__Particles__ are words exerting grammatical functions. They start with a
single _non-sonorant consonant_, followed only by _vowels_ and _h_, like __pa__,
__mio__ or __tiho__. Particles are themselves categorized into __families__
having identical grammar but different meanings.

All other words are __predicate words__ and express intrinsic meanings such as
"cat", "language" or "teach". They are grouped into the following categories :

### Roots

__Roots__ are the building blocks of the language and express meanings that
would be hard or too long to convey otherwise. They can either :

- start with a single _non-sonorant consonant_ followed by a mix of _vowels_ and
  at least one _sonorant_ or _medial consonant pair_, like __ban__, __mana__,
  __cuina__ or __marne__.
- start with a valid _initial consonant pair_ followed by a mix of _vowels_ and
  any number of _sonorants_ or _medial consonant pairs_ (even none), like
  __bju__, __cpena__ or __djin__.

A _sonorant_ can appear only between 2 _vowels_ or at the end of the root, while
a medial pair can appear only between 2 _vowels_, but not at the end.

The following chart shows __initial pairs__ in blue, __medial pairs__ in red, and
invalid pairs in gray :

### Borrowings

__Borrowings__ allow importing foreign words or names. They are prefixed by the
vowel __u__, and they may contain any number of _non-sonorant consonants_. Consonant clusters in borrowings must obey the following rules :

 - Consonant pairs must either be _initial pairs_, _medial pairs_, _sonorant_ +
_consonant_, or _consonant_ + _sonorant_.
 - Consonant triplets C1C2C3 are valid if C1C2 is a medial pair *and* C2C3 is an initial pair.
 - Alternatively, consonant triplets can be a _sonorant_ followed
by an _initial pair_. Triplets must fulfill either condition to be valid.

Borrowings must end with a _vowel_, or a _vowel_ plus a single _sonorant_.
In written media, borrowings must be followed by either spaces or a word boundary
marker, while in oral speech either the penultimate vowel must be stressed, or
the word is not stressed and ends when a pause occurs. Similarly, the initial
__u__ must be either preceded by spaces or a word boundary marker, and realized
orally as either a pause or a glottal stop.

Examples with stressed vowel in italics : __udjon*a*tan__, __*u*bar__.

### Assignable names

__Assignable names__ allow defining predicates with a custom name. They follow
the same morphology as _borrowings_ but use the __i__ prefix instead of __u__.

### Compounds

__Compounds__ allow making new words from multiple other kind of words. They
start by either __e__, __a__ or __o__ and follow the same rule as the
__u__ of borrowings. Their structure will be detailed later in this book.

### Example

With spaces : _pa za umia tsen eberban_  
Without spaces : _paza'umia'tsen'eberban_

Particles : _pa_, _za_  
Borrowing : _umia_  
Assignable name: _abar_  
Root : _tsen_  
Compound : _eberban_

### Reasoning

Outside of borrowings and assignable names, encountering a _non-sonorant
consonant_ or a word boundary marker means it is the start of a new word; unless
it the first letter of a _medial consonant pair_ which cannot be misunderstood
as the start of a new word. Word boundary markers or spaces before vowel-initial
words allow to prevent them from "merging" into the previous word. The end of
borrowings can easily be recognized with the suffixed space or marker, or stress
in speech.

These simple rules prevent any ambiguity of word boundaries, which is called a
__Self-Segregating Morphology__.
